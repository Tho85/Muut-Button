# Muut Button firmware

A firmware for ATtiny85 microcontrollers that can mute/unmute and hang up calls in video conferencing sofware.

## Overview

This firmware emulates a USB HID Telephony device with buttons and status LEDs. When attaching a hardware button, it can be used to mute/unmute and hang up calls in video conferencing software. The built-in LED (or an optional RGB LED ring) visualizes the current mute/unmute/call state.

The firmware presents itself as a generic HID device to the host PC and can be used in video conferencing software like Google Meet without the need for additional software, extensions etc.

## Features

The firmware emulates the following usages according to the USB HID specification (see [HID Usage Tables](https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_4.pdf)):

| Page name        | Page ID | Usage name  | Usage ID |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| LED              | `0x08`  | Mute        | `0x09`   |
| LED              | `0x08`  | Off-Hook    | `0x17`   |
| Telephony Device | `0x0B`  | Hook Switch | `0x20`   |
| Telephony Device | `0x0B`  | Drop        | `0x26`   |
| Telephony Device | `0x0B`  | Phone Mute  | `0x2F`   |
